# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a layout issue where the theme selector dropdown overlaps with the "Your Tasks" card when opened. The issue occurs specifically in desktop layouts where the theme dropdown's absolute positioning causes it to appear over content in the task list section, creating a poor user experience and potential accessibility concerns.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme dropdown to have appropriate z-index layering, so that it appears above all other content when opened.

4. WHEN the theme dropdown is opened THEN the system SHALL not be obscured by any other page elements
5. IF there are other dropdowns or modals THEN the system SHALL ensure proper z-index hierarchy

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme dropdown positioning to be visually pleasing and intuitive, so that the interface feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme dropdown opens THEN the system SHALL position it in a visually logical location relative to the theme button
2. WHEN the theme dropdown is visible THEN the system SHALL ensure adequate spacing from page edges and other elements
