# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Update CSS z-index hierarchy and positioning

    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5, 3.4_

  - [ ] 3.2 Add dynamic positioning logic
    - Implement applyCollisionAvoidance() function to adjust dropdown position
    - Create positioning strategy selection based on available space
    - Add fallback positioning for edge cases
    - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.1, 4.4_

- [ ] 4. Integrate positioning system with theme selector

  - [ ] 4.1 Update theme selector event handlers

    - Modify theme dropdown open/close handlers to include positioning logic
    - Add positioning calculation before showing dropdown
    - Ensure positioning updates when dropdown content changes
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.2, 5.1_

  - [ ] 4.2 Add viewport resize handling
    - Implement handleViewportResize() function with debouncing
    - Update dropdown positioning when window is resized
    - Handle orientation changes on mobile devices
    - _Requirements: 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 5. Enhance accessibility and focus management

  - Ensure focus remains within dropdown during positioning changes
  - Maintain keyboard navigation functionality regardless of position
  - Add ARIA live region announcements for significant positioning changes
  - Test screen reader compatibility with dynamic positioning
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 6. Add performance optimizations

  - [ ] 6.1 Implement measurement caching

    - Cache frequently used element measurements
    - Add cache invalidation on layout changes
    - Optimize DOM queries to minimize layout thrashing
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.4_

  - [ ] 6.2 Add debounced event handling
    - Implement debounced resize event handler
    - Add throttled scroll event handling if needed
    - Optimize positioning calculations for smooth performance
    - _Requirements: 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 7. Test positioning across all layouts and themes

  - [ ] 7.1 Test desktop grid layout positioning

    - Verify dropdown doesn't overlap with task list section
    - Test positioning with varying task list heights
    - Ensure proper spacing from all page elements
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 4.1_

  - [ ] 7.2 Test responsive behavior across screen sizes

    - Verify positioning on mobile devices (320px to 767px)
    - Test tablet layout positioning (768px to 1023px)
    - Confirm desktop positioning (1024px and above)
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

  - [ ] 7.3 Test theme compatibility
    - Verify positioning works correctly with all five themes
    - Ensure dropdown visibility and contrast in all themes
    - Test theme switching while dropdown is open
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 8. Validate accessibility compliance

  - Test keyboard navigation with new positioning system
  - Verify screen reader announcements work correctly
  - Ensure focus management remains intact during positioning changes
  - Test with assistive technologies across different positions
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 9. Cross-browser compatibility testing

  - Test positioning logic in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
  - Verify CSS positioning works consistently across browsers
  - Test JavaScript collision detection in different browser engines
  - Ensure fallback positioning works in older browsers
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.4, 3.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 10. Performance and edge case testing
  - Test positioning performance with large task lists
  - Verify behavior when multiple dropdowns might be present
  - Test edge cases like very narrow viewports
  - Ensure graceful degradation when JavaScript fails
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 3.4, 4.4_
