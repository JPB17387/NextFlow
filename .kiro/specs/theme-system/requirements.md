# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add a comprehensive theme system to the Task Dashboard MVP application, allowing users to personalize their experience by choosing from multiple visual themes. The system will include five distinct themes: Dark, White (Light), Student, Developer, and Professional, each designed to cater to different user preferences and use cases. The theme selection will be persistent across browser sessions and provide smooth transitions between themes.
