# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NextFlow Task Dashboard application is currently non-functional due to critical JavaScript syntax errors in the theme-manager.js file. These syntax errors are preventing the application from loading and executing properly, breaking core functionality including task management, theme switching, and user interface interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN all JavaScript files SHALL execute without syntax errors
2. WHEN the browser console is checked THEN there SHALL be no JavaScript syntax errors reported
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the theme manager SHALL initialize successfully
4. WHEN the application loads THEN all core functionality SHALL be available (task management, theme switching, clock, suggestions)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, properly formatted JavaScript code so that the application is maintainable and debuggable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the theme-manager.js file THEN all function definitions SHALL be complete and properly closed

4. WHEN reviewing the theme-manager.js file THEN all string literals SHALL be properly closed
5. WHEN reviewing the theme-manager.js file THEN all object literals SHALL have proper syntax

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the test integration script to work properly so that I can verify the application is functioning correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the validate-integration.js script SHALL execute without errors
2. WHEN the integration validation runs THEN it SHALL properly check theme manager availability
3. WHEN the integration validation runs THEN it SHALL report success or failure clearly
4. WHEN there are issues THEN the validation SHALL provide helpful error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper file organization so that test files are in the correct location and the application structure is clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN all test files SHALL be located in the tests/ directory
2. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL only load necessary production files, not test files
3. WHEN running tests THEN test files SHALL be easily accessible and properly organized
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the HTML SHALL not reference test files in production mode
